### **Features**

- **Real-time Strength Evaluation**: Assess the strength of a password immediately after it is entered.
- **Password Properties Analysis**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the password's composition and structure, helping users understand strengths and weaknesses.
- **Crack Time Estimation**: Predicts how long it would take for an attacker to crack the password using brute force or dictionary-based attacks.
