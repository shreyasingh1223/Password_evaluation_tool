### **Features**

- **Real-time Password Strength Evaluation**: Determine if a password is weak, medium, or strong based on its length and complexity.
- **assword Composition Analysis**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the password's composition and structure, helping users understand strengths and weaknesses.
- **Estimated Crack Time**: Predicts how long it would take for an attacker to crack the password using brute force or dictionary-based attacks.
